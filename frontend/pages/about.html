            <p>
              Our mission extends beyond simply providing online tools. Here at New Horizon, we aim to create a
              digital space that encourages openness, self-reflection, and growth.
              Through guided wellness exercises, discussion forums, and reliable educational
              resources, we invite individuals to explore their mental health at their own pace.
            </p>
            <p>
              New Horizon also focuses on reducing the stigma surrounding mental health.
              We believe that understanding and compassion should be at the center of every
              conversation about wellness. By connecting people to supportive communities and
              evidence-based information, we help promote resilience, balance, and hope.

            <p>
              We envision a future where seeking help for mental well-being is seen as an act of
              strength and self-care, not a source of shame.
              New Horizon aspires to be a bridge between individuals and the resources they need
              to thrive, whether that's through mindfulness, education, or community connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              By designing an inclusive and easy-to-navigate platform, we want users from all
              backgrounds and ages to find the tools that fit their journey.
              Our vision is not just to inform, but to inspire lasting positive change,
              one small step at a time.

          <div class="about-card__content">
            <p>
              In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to overlook mental well-being.
              Social pressures, financial stress, and everyday responsibilities often make it
              difficult for people to prioritize self-care.
              New Horizon was developed with the understanding that mental wellness
              should be simple and free of judgment.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recognize that not everyone has access to professional support,
              which is why our platform focuses on providing helpful tools and
              community-based learning. Each section of New Horizon is designed to
              encourage small, achievable actions that make a big difference over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              By fostering awareness and connection, we hope to make mental wellness
              a shared responsibility. One that empowers individuals to look out
              for themselves and for each other.
